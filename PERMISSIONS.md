How warp decides **who can see, book, and manage** seats. This document is the
authoritative description of the access model. For definitions of the terms used
here (zone, plan, assignment, …) see [GLOSSARY.md](GLOSSARY.md).

## 1. The three independent dimensions

Access is the combination of **three separate things**. Keeping them apart is the
key to understanding the whole model:

```
  ┌─────────────────────┐   ┌──────────────────────┐   ┌────────────────────┐
  │  ACCOUNT TYPE        │   │  ZONE TYPE           │   │  ZONE ROLE         │

  └─────────────────────┘   └──────────────────────┘   └────────────────────┘
           │                            │                          │
           └──────────────┬─────────────┴──────────────┬──────────┘

                 site admins are            ZONE TYPE + ZONE ROLE  ⇒  EFFECTIVE
                 super-users (§4)           combine per zone (§3)      ZONE ROLE
```

* **Account type** is the *global* role of the login (site admin / regular /
  blocked). It is checked at sign-in and gates the admin screens.
* **Zone type** is a property of the *zone* and sets a baseline that applies to
  *everyone*, even people with no explicit grant.
* **Zone role** is an explicit grant of a level (admin / user / viewer) to a
  *user or group* in a *specific zone*.

Zone type and zone role combine into the **effective zone role** — the level a
person really has in that zone.

> **Numeric convention (in code):** for both account type and zone role, **lower
> number = more powerful**. Admin = 10, user = 20, viewer = 30. "Most permissive"
> therefore means "smallest number", which is why the code uses `MIN`.

---

## 2. Account types (global role)

| Account type | Sign in? | Admin screens? | Booking ability |
|---|:--:|:--:|---|
| **Site administrator** | yes | yes | super-user over every zone & plan (§4) |
| **Regular user** | yes | no | governed entirely by effective zone roles (§3) |
| **Blocked** | no | – | – |
| **Group** | no (cannot sign in) | – | a vehicle for granting zone roles in bulk (§5) |

Only site administrators can open **Users**, **Groups**, **Zones**, and
**Plans** management, and the backend re-checks this on every related request —
hiding a menu item is never the only line of defence.

---

## 3. Effective zone role = zone type ⊕ zone role

For a given user and a given zone, the **effective zone role** is computed from
the zone's *type* and the user's *specific role* in that zone (the specific role
already includes everything inherited from groups — see §5).

The rule:

1. **Disabled** zone → effective role is **admin** *only if* the user has an
   explicit zone-admin grant; otherwise **no access**. (Disabled zones are
   locked down: even an admin cannot *book*, only re-enable — see §7.)
2. Otherwise, the zone type grants a **baseline for everyone**:
   * Public (book) → everyone is a **zone user**
   * Public (view) → everyone is a **zone viewer**
   * Enabled (private) → everyone is **nothing**
3. The effective role is the **most permissive** of {explicit role, baseline}
   (i.e. the smaller number). No access if both are empty.

### The full matrix

Columns are the explicit zone role the user holds (possibly via a group); rows
are the zone type. Cells are the **effective** role.

| Zone type ↓ \ Explicit role → | **(none)** | **viewer** | **user** | **admin** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Disabled**       | no access | no access | no access | **admin** |
| **Enabled**        | no access | viewer    | user     | admin |
| **Public (view)**  | viewer    | viewer    | user     | admin |
| **Public (book)**  | **user**  | user      | user     | admin |

Things worth noting in the matrix:

* A **public (view)** zone makes seats visible to all, but only people with an
  explicit *user*/*admin* grant can actually book.
* A **public (book)** zone lets *anyone signed in* book — and an explicit
  *viewer* grant cannot demote them below that public baseline (they still get
  *user*). You can only ever be raised to the more permissive level.
* A **disabled** zone ignores *viewer*/*user* grants entirely; only an explicit
  *admin* keeps any access at all (and even then, not booking).

---

## 4. Site administrators are super-users

A site administrator (account type *administrator*) is treated as a **zone admin
of every zone**, including zones nobody explicitly assigned them to. Concretely
they can:

* open and view **any** plan and its seats;
* manage seats anywhere (enable/disable, assign);
* book for themselves in any non-disabled zone, and book *as* any user who is
  allowed in that zone.

This makes the booking screens behave consistently with the management screens
(which already treat the site admin as owner of everything). The **disabled-zone
"no booking" rule still applies even to site admins** (§7).

**One deliberate exception — self auto-book.** When a site admin uses "find me a
seat" *for themselves*, the super-user bypass is **not** applied to seat
selection: auto-book only considers zones where the admin has a *regular* grant
(or that are public-bookable), exactly as it would for any other user. Otherwise
an admin could be auto-booked into a zone they merely oversee but never sit in.
The bypass still applies to viewing, managing, and booking *as* another user.

> Implementation note: the booking endpoints (`getSeats`, `apply`, `autoBook`)
> short-circuit to *zone admin* when `flask.g.isAdmin` is set, mirroring the
> bypasses already present in the view layer (`view.plan`, `view.planImage`,
> `zone.getUsers`). A site admin therefore does **not** need a `zone_assign` row
> to use a plan.

---

## 5. Groups and role nesting

Zone roles can be granted to a **group** instead of an individual. Every member
of the group then inherits that grant, and membership is **transitive** — a
member of a sub-group is a member.

When a user ends up with **several** grants for the same zone (their own grant
plus one or more via groups), they keep the **most permissive** one (the
smallest role number):

```
   user "alice"
     ├─ direct grant on Zone 1 ........... viewer (30)
     ├─ member of group "team"  ─ grant on Zone 1 ... user (20)
     └─ member of group "leads" ─ grant on Zone 1 ... admin (10)
                                                       ─────────
   alice's specific role in Zone 1 = MIN(30,20,10) =  admin (10)
```

This "specific role" is then fed into the effective-role rule of §3. Group
accounts themselves never get access (they cannot sign in); only the human
members do.

---

## 6. What each effective role can do

| Capability | viewer | user | zone admin / site admin |
|---|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| See the plan & its seats | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| See who has booked (where shown) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Book a seat for themselves | – | ✓ | ✓ |
| Cancel **their own** existing booking | ✓¹ | ✓ | ✓ |
| See **disabled** seats | – | – | ✓ |
| Enable / disable seats | – | – | ✓ |
| Assign seats to users / everyone | – | – | ✓ |
| Book / cancel **as another user** | – | – | ✓² |

¹ A viewer can always remove a booking they already hold (e.g. left over after a
zone was switched to view-only), but cannot create new ones.
² Booking as another user additionally requires the *target* to be allowed to
book in that zone (see §8).

### Plan-level mode

A plan can mix zones, so the screen picks a mode from the user's roles across all
zones on that plan:

* **Admin mode** — the user administers *at least one* zone on the plan (or is a
  site admin). The assign / enable / disable / book-as tools appear.
* **Viewer mode** — the user can only *view* every zone they can reach on the
  plan (no booking anywhere). The booking actions and the auto-book button are
  hidden.
* **Normal mode** — otherwise; the user can book in the zones where their
  effective role is *user* or better, and just view the rest.

Within a mixed plan each seat is still judged by *its own* zone: a user might
book seats in the enabled zone while only viewing seats in a public-view zone on
the same map.

---

## 7. Booking rules (after access is established)

Having *book* access to a zone is necessary but not sufficient. A booking is
accepted only when **all** of these hold:

1. **Effective role is *user* or better** for the seat's zone.
2. **The zone is not disabled.** Disabled zones reject booking for *everyone*,
   including zone admins and site admins — you must re-enable the zone first.
3. **The seat is enabled.**
4. **The time is inside the booking window** (the installation's weeks-in-advance
   horizon). Site admins are exempt from the window only when booking via the
   API for themselves; the normal screens still enforce it.
5. **Assignment check** — if the seat has any assignment, the booker must be a
   named assignee or be covered by an *everyone* assignment, **and** the date
   must fall within that assignment's days-in-advance window (see *release time*
   in the glossary).
6. **No conflict** — the seat is free for the time, and the user does not already
   hold another seat in the same **zone group** (or, for an ungrouped zone, the
   same zone) at an overlapping time.

Rule 6 is enforced at the database level, so it holds no matter which path
(manual, auto-book, calendar link) created the booking.

---

## 8. Booking on behalf of others ("book as")

Both manual booking and auto-book can act for another user. The rules:

* **The actor must be a zone admin of the seat's zone** (site admins qualify
  everywhere). Being an admin of a *different* zone on the same plan is not
  enough — e.g. an admin of the enabled zone cannot book-as into a public-book
  zone on the same plan unless they also administer that public-book zone.
* **The target must be allowed to book in that zone** — i.e. the *target's*
  effective role must be *user* or better. You cannot park a booking on someone
  who has no business in the zone. (In a public-book zone that is everyone; in a
  public-view zone only users with an explicit grant; in an enabled zone only
  those granted *user*/*admin*.)
* **Disabled zones** still reject the booking outright.

For **auto-book as**, the candidate seats are additionally **confined to the
zones the actor administers** (all zones, for a site admin). So a zone admin
auto-booking for someone else can only ever place them in the zones that admin
controls.

For **auto-book for yourself**, the pool is the zones where *you* have a regular
booking grant (or that are public-bookable). A site admin's super-user bypass is
intentionally excluded here (§4), so auto-book never picks a zone you only
oversee or have no real stake in.

```

(For *book as*, run the booking-access checks against the **target** user and
additionally require the **actor** to administer S's zone — §8.)

## 10. Worked examples

A plan **"Office"** has three zones:

* **Open** — public (book)
* **Quiet** — enabled (private); *Bob* is zone admin, *Carol* is zone user
* **Lab** — disabled; *Bob* is zone admin

| Person | Open | Quiet | Lab | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Dana** (no grants) | book | – | – | public-book gives everyone *user* in Open |
| **Carol** (user in Quiet) | book | book | – | sees Lab? no — disabled & no admin grant |
| **Bob** (admin Quiet+Lab) | book | book+manage | view+manage | cannot *book* in Lab (disabled), only manage |
| **Site admin** | book+manage | book+manage | view+manage | super-user; still cannot book in Lab |

Book-as on this plan:

* Bob books **as Carol** in **Quiet** → ✅ (Bob admins Quiet, Carol may book there).
* Bob books **as Dana** in **Open** → ❌ Bob is only a *user* of Open, not its
  admin; he cannot book-as there (even though Dana herself could book).
* Bob auto-books **as Carol** across the plan → only ever lands in **Quiet**
  (the zone Bob administers where Carol can book); never in Open or Lab.
* Site admin books **as Dana** in **Open** → ✅ (super-user admins Open; Dana may
  book there).

# WARP: Workspace Autonomous Reservation Program

The story of this project begins when, due to COVID-19, we have converted our regular office into a hybrid of regular and hot-desk assignments. We needed to find a solution for desk reservations, transparency of that, and detailed logging of who was in the office for epidemic purposes.

I've quickly evaluated a couple of existing solutions, but they were either too big and complicated and/or too expensive. As I assumed that other people would have the same challenge I had, I decided to spend my after-hours time making an open-source tailored system for the need. Yes - it is free as speech, not as beer.

## What WARP can do
- It allows people to book / change / unbook desks (or even parking stalls) in the office.
- It allows people to check who else will be in the office.
- It works on mobile.
- All is done in an easy, visual way.
- Generate a report of past bookings and export it to Excel file

## More advanced features
- Seats can be limited to certain people, so other people cannot book them (it is called assigned seats).
- Seats can be disabled, so people don't see them at all.
- Multiple zones (maps) can be created, for example, floors or parking.
- Zones can be grouped. One person can have only one seat booked simultaneously in a zone group (so you can have one group for floors and another group for parking stalls).
- Admin(s) can book / modify / unbook seat for any user.
- Full admin interface to add/remove/edit maps, zones, groups, and users.
- SAML2.0 support - via Apache [mod_auth_mellon](https://github.com/latchset/mod_auth_mellon) module.
- Translations - currently, English and Polish are supported.

## What I'm not even planning to do
- Approvals - the main goal of the system was to make it autonomous and management-free. So I don't intend to implement approval flows.
- Timezone support - the selected time is always in the same timezone as a zone. It works well and is simple. But in case someone would like to have a couple of zones in different timezones and keep the `one person one seat at a given time` rule across these timezones, this will fail.

## What browsers are supported
To be honest, I was not paying much attention to browser compatibility, nor was I extensively testing it on other browsers than Chrome and Firefox. Nevertheless, all modern browsers should be supported (definitely not IE).

## Is there any demo?

It is so easy to run it via docker compose that I have removed the demo, which was available some time ago.

# Deployment

During the first run on an empty database, WARP will populate the database schema and create an admin user.

Default admin credentials are: `admin:noneshallpass`

## Demo quickstart

The preferred way to deploy is to run it via Docker. You need a working docker, and I won't cover it here.

### docker compose

From the command line:
```
# clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/sebo-b/warp.git
$ cd warp

$ docker compose -f demo_compose.yaml up
```

After that, open http://127.0.0.1:8080 in your browser and log in as `admin` with password `noneshallpass`.

### without docker compose (but why?)

From the command line:
```
# clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/sebo-b/warp.git
$ cd warp

# build docker image (you can skip hash if you don't want to track it)
$ export GIT_HASH=`git log -1 --format=%h`
$ docker build -t warp:latest -t warp:$GIT_HASH .

# install postrgres (what I cover here is a simplistic way just to run a demo)
$ docker pull postgres
$ docker run --name warp-demo-db -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres_password -d postgres
$ export WARP_DEMO_DB_IP=`docker inspect  -f '{{range.NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' warp-demo-db`

# start warp
$ docker run --name warp-demo-wsgi \
> --env 'WARP_DATABASE=postgresql://postgres:postgres_password@warp-demo-db:5432/postgres' \
> --env WARP_SECRET_KEY=mysecretkey \
> --env WARP_DATABASE_INIT_SCRIPT='["sql/schema.sql","sql/sample_data.sql"]' \
> --add-host=warp-demo-db:${WARP_DEMO_DB_IP} -d warp:latest
$ export WARP_DEMO_WSGI_IP=`docker inspect  -f '{{range.NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' warp-demo-wsgi`

# install nginx as wsgi rewerse proxy
$ docker pull nginx
$ docker run --add-host=warp-demo-wsgi:${WARP_DEMO_WSGI_IP} --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)"/res/nginx.conf,target=/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf,readonly -d -p 127.0.0.1:8080:80 nginx
```

After that, open http://127.0.0.1:8080 in your browser and log in as `admin` with password `noneshallpass`.

### without Docker - the old way

You need a working Python3 environment, Node.js, and PostgreSQL, and I won't cover it here. This is not a preferred way, use it only for debugging or development purposes. Things may change, and this section can be outdated - but I assume that you know what you are doing.

From the command line:

```
# clone repo
$ git clone https://github.com/sebo-b/warp.git
$ cd warp

# create virtual envirnoment and activate it
$ python3 -m venv --prompt warp .venv
$ source .venv/bin/activate

# install python requirements
# if this raises an error in psycopg2, either install its all build dependencies
# or change psycopg2 to psycopg2-binary in requirements.txt
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

# compile JavaScript files
$ pushd js
$ npm ci
$ npm run build
$ popd

# setup Flask and database URL
$ export FLASK_APP=warp
# export FLASK_ENV=development //deprecated
$ export FLASK_DEBUG=true
# postgresql://username:password@server:port/database
# old export WARP_DATABASE=postgresql://warp:warp@localhost:5432/warp
$ export WARP_DATABASE=postgresql://flaskuser:postgres_password@localhost:5432/warp
$ export WARP_SECRET_KEY='mysecretkey'

# run the app
$ flask run
```

After that, open http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your browser and log in as `admin` with password `noneshallpass`.

## Production environment

For the production envirnoment, I recommend running Nginx and PostgreSQL on separate VMs. Then (even multiple) WARP image can be simply started via Docker and rev-proxed from Nginx.

Each configuration parameter (check config.py) can be passed via the envirnoment as `WARP_varname`.

### SECRET_KEY

For the production environment, **make sure** that you have generated `SECRET_KEY` used for signing cookies. It is defined in `config.py.`

Flask documentation mentions this method to generate it:
```
$ python -c 'import os; print(os.urandom(16))'
```

Alternatively, you can use OpenSSL and Sed:
```
$ openssl rand -hex 16 | sed 's/\(..\)/\\x\1/g;s/^/b"/;s/$/"/'
```
or wrap it into Python:
```
$ python -c 'from subprocess import run; print(run(["openssl","rand","16"],capture_output=True).stdout)'
```

### Language

Change `LANGUAGE_FILE` variable in `config.py` or set `WARP_LANGUAGE_FILE` environment variable. Currently, language is global for the instance.

### How to import users

You can add them manually one by one via the users' management tab or import them directly to the database. Basically, insert users to `user` table, look at the table definition in `warp/sql/schema.sql.`

The role is one of:
```
10 - admin
20 - regular user
90 - account blocked
```

Password is a hash used by `werkzeug.security.check_password_hash` (more documentation can be [found here](https://werkzeug.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/utils/#werkzeug.security.generate_password_hash)), by default (in my configuration) it is pbkdf2:sha256 with 16 bytes salt and 260,000 iterations.

You can generate it with Python (just make sure you have activated the environment where Flask is installed):
```
python -c 'from getpass import getpass; from werkzeug.security import generate_password_hash; print(generate_password_hash(getpass()))'

```
